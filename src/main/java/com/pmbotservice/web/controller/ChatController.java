                    Stateless pass-through: this endpoint validates the request, forwards it to \
                    the ML Agent (through a circuit breaker, bulkhead, timeout, and limited retry — \
                    see the architecture doc), and streams the response back. It does not store the \
                    message, the response, or any conversation history — nothing here persists \
                    between requests.

                    `X-Tenant-Id` and `X-Org-Id` request headers, and the body's `message`, are \
                    required; `caseId` is optional. The ML Agent's contract has no conversation/continuation \
                    identifier at all — `history` is the sole resumption mechanism: omit it to start \
                    a new conversation, or resend the full transcript (oldest turn first) to continue \
                    one. `requestId` is an optional caller-generated identifier forwarded for \
                    tracing/correlation only (idempotency-friendly, not deduplicated anywhere). The \
                    caller — not this backend — is responsible for remembering and resending `history`.

                    SSE event contract — the ML Agent's (Thoughtful Labs `ChatAgent.AskCaseManager`)                     response, forwarded as-is. This backend does not rename events or fields,                     reshape payloads, or add its own wrapper. For every ML Agent `AnswerEvent`:
                    - `event:` is the name of the `AnswerEvent` oneof field that is set — one of                     `chunk`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `payload`, `done`, `error`, `ping`.
                    - `data:` is that whole `AnswerEvent` as canonical proto3 JSON, with the                     original `.proto` field names and nesting (see `src/main/proto/*.proto`): e.g.                     `{"tool_call":{"tool_call_id":"t-1","name":"getCase","args_json":"{...}"}}`.                     Enums are their proto names (`STATUS_OK`, `STOP_REASON_TRUNCATED`,                     `ERROR_CODE_MODEL_REFUSED`), fields at their default value are still present,                     and `int64` fields (`ms`, `row_count`, `latency_ms`, `tokens_in`, `tokens_out`)                     are JSON strings, per the proto3 JSON mapping.
                    - `id:` is a 0-based frame counter added by this backend (SSE transport only).

                    Events arrive in the order the ML Agent produced them. The ML Agent's own                     contract rules apply unchanged: consecutive `chunk` events form one text block;                     `payload` may arrive at any point; `done` and `error` are terminal; `ping` is a                     keepalive with no content; clients must ignore event names they don't recognise.                     The ML Agent's `error` event (a model-level failure: `code`, `retryable`) is                     forwarded like any other event, never translated.

                    The one event this backend adds: `service_error` —                     { messageId, errorCode, errorMessage, timestamp } — sent (terminal) only when a                     failure produced no ML Agent event of its own: the agent could not be reached,                     timed out, or rejected the call at the transport level, or this backend's own                     circuit breaker/bulkhead/validation stopped it. `errorCode` is one of                     ML_AGENT_TIMEOUT, ML_AGENT_UNAVAILABLE, ML_AGENT_ERROR, NOT_FOUND,                     VALIDATION_ERROR, CONCURRENCY_LIMIT_REACHED (bulkhead full or circuit breaker                     open), INTERNAL_ERROR. Because the HTTP status is already committed to 200 by                     then, these always arrive on this same stream, never as a different HTTP status.

                    For local testing, the mock ML Agent recognizes these keywords anywhere in \
                    `message` to simulate each failure mode: `trigger:slow`, `trigger:timeout`, \
                    `trigger:error`, `trigger:empty`, `trigger:rejected`.

                    Swagger UI's "Try it out" does not render a live SSE stream well (it waits \
                    for the connection to end, then shows the buffered body). To watch events \
                    arrive in real time, use curl instead:

                    ```
                    curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:8079/back-office-ai/pm/api/v1/chat/messages" \\
                      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\

                    ```
