/**
 * Identity/scoping context for a single request: who is calling, and for which tenant/organization.
 * Resolved once per request by a {@link RequestContextResolver} and threaded explicitly through
 * service calls (deliberately not stored in a ThreadLocal or ambient holder) so tenant scoping is
 * compiler-checked at every boundary and cannot be silently dropped or leaked across an executor
 * hop.
 *
 * <p>{@code tenantId}/{@code organization} come from the {@code X-Tenant-Id}/ {@code X-Org-Id}
 * request headers (see {@link RequestHeaders}), not the request body. {@code X-Tenant-Id} is
 * required on every request; {@code X-Org-Id} is optional, and {@code organization} is {@code null}
 * when it is missing or blank.
 *
 * <p>{@code accessToken} is {@code null} in {@code chatbot.security.mode: NONE} (no BFF session to
 * source it from) and the BFF-issued {@code access_token} in {@code mode: BFF_SESSION}. It is
 * forwarded to the ML Agent only as {@code authorization: Bearer} gRPC call metadata (see {@code
 * GrpcMlAgentClient}); {@link #toString()} redacts it so it can't reach a log line by accident.
