/**
 * The exact set of rejection reasons the (currently minimal) authentication flow can produce. Each
 * one carries its log token (log lines only), the HTTP status, the {@link ErrorCode} returned in
 * the response body, and the client-facing message template.
 *
 * <p>Message templates take two positional arguments — {@code %1$s} the configured session cookie
 * name, {@code %2$s} the configured tenant header name — so they stay accurate if either is
 * reconfigured. Messages describe what the client must do; they never echo the cookie value, the
 * Redis key, or which of the not-found sub-causes (expired, wrong tenant, malformed record) applied
 * — that detail is in the server logs, keyed by correlation ID.
